* What happens when you initialize a repository? 
* Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is created.
We do this so we can commit.

* How is the staging area different from the working directory and
 the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to choose which files you wanted commited
while still keeping all the same files in the working directory.
It gives more flexibility in choosing what to commit.
